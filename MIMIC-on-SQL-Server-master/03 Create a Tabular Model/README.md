SQL Server Analysis Services Tabular Models provide a semantic layer on top of the databases.  

This makes it easier for users to analyze the data, using either Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables or Microsoft's new PowerBI Desktop application.

This folder contains a tabular model built on the CHARTEVENTS data.  Data in related tables was also imported into the tabular model.
